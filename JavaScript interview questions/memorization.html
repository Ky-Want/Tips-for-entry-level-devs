Question: What is memorization?

Answer: Memorization is a storage technique that is designed to speed up computer programs.
A program memorizes the output of an expensive function, so if it requires this output again, it will not have to run that function again but instead just call its stored value.
Memorization in JavaScript depends on a combination of two concepts:
1) Closures
2) Higher order functions
