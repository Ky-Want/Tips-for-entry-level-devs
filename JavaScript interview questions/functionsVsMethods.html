Question: What is the difference between functions and methods?

Answer: The major difference between methods and functions in JavaScript is that methods are called on objects while functions are not.
Methods are called on objects with a dot operator while functions are called using parentheses.
The method accepts arguments through an object parameter, and the function accepts arguments through a parenthesis parameter.
