Question: Why "Use Strict" is used in JavaScript?

Answer: 'Use Strict' is used in JavaScript to make sure that you code is written correctly.
Strict mode enforces the following
*Variables must be declared before they are used
*All comparisons must be done between literal values
*No function call can be made until the function has been defined.
This helps to catch errors early on in the development process and keeps your code more organized.
