Question: What is the Hoisting in JavaScript?

Answer: Hoisting simply means that all declarations are lifted to the top of the scope, which may have them declared before or after other codes.
This means that even if you declare your variable after some other code, it will be available at the top of the scope - making it accessible outside of its original location
