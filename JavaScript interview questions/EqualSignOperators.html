Question: What is the difference between "==" and "===" operators?

Answer: 
0==false //true, because false is equivalent of 0.
0===false //false, because both operands are of different types.
2=="2" //true, auto type coercion, string converted into number.
2==="2" //false, since both operands are not of the same type.
