Question: Define anonymous function?

Answer:
let display = function()
{
  alert("Anonymous Function is Invoked");
}
display();

Additional Information: An anonymous function is a function that doesn't have a name. This is important because it allows the function to be called without having to specify the function's name.
This is useful when you want to keep the code secret.
This type of function is often used to create short, convenient code snippets.
