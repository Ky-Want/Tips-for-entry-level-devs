// in-line comments are lines of text that JavaScript will completely ignore.

Multi-line comments are similar to in-line comments,

// Data Types and variables: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
// Undefined is something that hasn't been defined yet. So you may have a variable that you haven't set to anything yet.
// Null means nothing, so you've set something to be something, and that something is nothing.
// Boolean means true or false.
// String. The string object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters. Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method.
// Symbol
// Number
// Object
